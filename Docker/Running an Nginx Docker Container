    • docker pull nginx

Run docker images to make sure the repository is in the list of images
    • docker images

Next, running the container in a specified named application, also use -d to run detached from the kernel. Also the -p specifies a host port that the docker port can access through.
    • docker run - - name first_web_server -p 7090:80 -d nginx

    • docker rmi nginx
